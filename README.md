## Overview

The Visualization Toolkit, or VTK, is a cornerstone in the field of 3D graphics and scientific visualization:

- **What is VTK?**
  - VTK is an advanced 3D graphics and visualization software library that has been empowering scientific and data visualization, 3D graphics, and image processing.

- **The Toolkit's Features:**
  - It offers an extensive collection of algorithms, providing hundreds of tools tailored for various visualization needs.

- **Development and Maintenance:**
  - Since 1993, Kitware Inc. has been the driving force behind VTK, ensuring continuous development and maintenance.

- **Open-Source and Cross-Language:**
  - Being open-source, VTK invites collaboration and expansion. While it's primarily written in C++, it also offers Python, Java, and Tcl bindings.

## Getting Started with VTK

### Installation Guide

For getting VTK up and running on your system:

- **Platform-Specific Instructions:**
  - Visit the [official VTK download page](https://vtk.org/download/) for detailed installation guides on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Basic Workflow in VTK

To harness the power of VTK effectively, follow this basic workflow:

1. **Data Input and Representation:** Your first step involves choosing the appropriate data structure for your dataset.

2. **Data Manipulation and Processing:** Next, apply a variety of filters and algorithms to manipulate and process the data as needed.

3. **Visualization and Rendering:** For the visual representation of data, make use of mappers, actors, and renderers.

4. **Interaction and Exporting:** Lastly, incorporate interactive elements into your visualization and utilize export functionalities as required.

## Running the Examples

### Setting Up Your Environment

To begin with your project, it's important to set up your environment properly. Here's how:

1. **Creating a Virtual Environment:** Use `virtualenv` or `conda` for isolating your project dependencies. This helps in managing packages specific to this project without affecting others.

2. **Activating and Installing Dependencies:** Once the virtual environment is created, activate it. Then, install all the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing Scripts

Running the scripts is straightforward. Just follow these steps:

- Navigate to the script's directory within the `src/` folder. For example, if you're looking to run a script about basic shapes:

```
cd src/01_basic_shapes
python circle.py
```

- The above command will execute the `circle.py` script, which demonstrates creating a simple circle using VTK.

### Using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

If you prefer using an IDE like Visual Studio Code or PyCharm, here's what you need to do:

1. **Project Setup:** Open your chosen IDE and load the project folder. This will make all your project files accessible in one place.

2. **Interpreter Configuration:** Configure the Python interpreter in your IDE to point to the virtual environment you created earlier. This ensures that your IDE uses the correct Python version and dependencies.

3. **Running Scripts:** Select the script you want to run. Use your IDE's tools (often a "Run" button) to execute the script.

4. **Debugging:** Leverage your IDE's debugging features like breakpoints and step-through debugging to analyze your scripts more closely.
